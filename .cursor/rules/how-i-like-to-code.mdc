# Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns, architecture, and technology of how a feature works, after it has been shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed.
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be effected by code changes.
- Use the KISS principle, which means keep it stupid simple and prefer solutions that don't have to make the average developer think too hard to understand it.
