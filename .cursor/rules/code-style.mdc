# Coding pattern preferences

- Prefer simple solutions
- Use the DRY principle, which means don't repeat yourself, whenever possible.
- Make changes only that are requested or when you well understand them and they are related to the change asked for.
- Do not introduce new patterns or technology when fixing a bug or issue.
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized.
- Try to limit length of files to about 200-400 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
- Do not mock data for implementation code or for test code.
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns.
- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming.
